Hi!
 
I&#39;ve been getting started with Twilio Video and I&#39;m running into a strange problem. I
can create the video room just fine, but I have a feature to turn the camera on and off
that isn&#39;t working. In my code, I&#39;m calling removeTrack(track) on the local track that I
want to remove but it doesn&#39;t work. 
Could you help me figure out what&#39;s wrong?
 
Thanks,
John Smith

Hi John,
    
    There are two ways to disable the video in local-track. Assuming Javascript SDK was used provided below snippets. 

Type 1: 
    room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.disable();
    });

Type 2: Although disabling a LocalVideoTrack whose source is a camera stops sending media, the camera is still reserved by the LocalVideoTrack and hence its light still stays on. In some use cases, the desired behavior might be that the light should turn off when users mutes their camera. Although this method is not recommend, this can be achieved by calling stop on the LocalVideoTrack and unpublishing it from the Room: 
    room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.stop();
        publication.unpublish();
    });

More details will be avialble in https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/javascript-getting-started#mute-your-local-media

Hi Twilio,
 
I just purchased an updated SSL certificate and installed it on my server that
receives webhooks from you, but you guys aren’t accepting it. What gives?! The
error says “Could not find path to certificate”. If you check my server you’ll see the
certificate is there. I’m totally down until you fix this, please get back to me ASAP.
 
Best,
I.M. Down

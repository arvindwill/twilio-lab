Hi!
 
I&#39;ve been getting started with Twilio Video and I&#39;m running into a strange problem. I
can create the video room just fine, but I have a feature to turn the camera on and off
that isn&#39;t working. In my code, I&#39;m calling removeTrack(track) on the local track that I
want to remove but it doesn&#39;t work. 
Could you help me figure out what&#39;s wrong?
 
Thanks,
John Smith

Hi John,
    
    There are two ways to disable the video in local-track. Assuming Javascript SDK was used provided below snippets. 

Type 1: 
    room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.disable();
    });

Type 2: Although disabling a LocalVideoTrack whose source is a camera stops sending media, the camera is still reserved by the LocalVideoTrack and hence its light still stays on. In some use cases, the desired behavior might be that the light should turn off when users mutes their camera. Although this method is not recommend, this can be achieved by calling stop on the LocalVideoTrack and unpublishing it from the Room: 
    room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.stop();
        publication.unpublish();
    });

Hi Twilio,
 
I just purchased an updated SSL certificate and installed it on my server that
receives webhooks from you, but you guys aren’t accepting it. What gives?! The
error says “Could not find path to certificate”. If you check my server you’ll see the
certificate is there. I’m totally down until you fix this, please get back to me ASAP.
 
Best,
I.M. Down

Hi Down,
    As per your mail, since SSL certificate are purchased it shoud not be self signed certificate(self sign certificate are not supported). Can you make sure all the certificate chains are concatenated and deployed in Web server. Currently uses CAs that are approved by Mozilla(https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/mozilla/IncludedCACertificateReport), Is your CA avaialble in that list? 
    Since the Production enivornment, for time being SSL Certiicate Validation can be disabled from https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings .

Hi Dustin,
    We dont have outage for for last few months, so that will not be problem. Generally timeout will happen if any changes happens to Infrastructure like changes in Firewall which blocks outbound 443 port. Can you able to run below command from server CLI and share the results. 

    Command 1: 
        >ping api.twilio.com
    Command 2:
        >telnet api.twilio.com 443 
    
    We also have detail documents which explains about various reasons for this error, hope it will be useful https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007130274-Requirements-for-Connecting-to-the-Twilio-REST-API-and-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues
